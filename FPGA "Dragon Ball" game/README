• An interactive game built by using Intel’s FPGA with "Dragon Ball" theme, 
  and allows the player to control a character through FPGA's buttons and switches, and perform various actions, such as moving, jumping, shooting (by various kinds of shots), killing enemies and getting score.

• Pproject was constructed by hierarchical design of integrated schematic blocks written in HDL – SystemVerilog, via Intel Quartos Prime.
  Each block was assigned for specific functionality to create modularity, and reused as possible in order to reduce resource consumption and improve performance.
  Design was Debugged through signal tap logic analyzer by making simulations along with running analyses and syntheses.
